Up-and-running with Ethereum and AlethZero on OS X.

1. Install homebrew (a package manager) by entering this command in Terminal (or your preferred command line client).
$ ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

Hint: The “$” symbol just delimits the command, don’t actually type it.

2. Run these commands (to make sure Homebrew itself is up-to-date):
$ brew update
$ brew upgrade —all

3. Now these (to install Ethereum and AlethZero):
$ brew tap ethereum/ethereum
$ brew install cpp-ethereum —--with-gui
$ brew linkapps cpp-ethereum

Hint: the install step might take a very long time if qt5 isn’t already installed. Like, hours. Maybe leave your computer on overnight.

AlethZero should now be available in your Applications folder (and typing “eth” in the command line will start the cpp-ethereum command line interface).
